# Module 3: Detect, Investigate & Respond

## Part 1 - Compromised AWS IAM credentials
### Detect and Investigate
#### Explore findings related to the access key (securityhub)
### Respond
#### Revoke the IAM role sessions (IAM)
#### Restart instance to rotate access keys (EC2)
#### Verify the the access keys have been rotated (Systems Manager)

## Part 2 - Compromised EC2 Instance
### Detect and Investigate 
#### Explore findings related to the instance ID (securityhub)
#### Determine if ssh password authentication is enabled (securityhub)
#### Determine if the attacker was able to login to the EC2 instance (CloudWatch logs)
### Respond
#### Modify the EC2 security group (EC2)

## Part 3 - Compromised S3 security
### Detect and Investigate 
#### Investigate any S3 related findings (securityhub)
#### Check if sensitive data was involved (Macie)
### Respond
#### Fix the S3 data bucket permissions and encryption (S3)

<p>Unfortunately, due to a misconfiguration in your environment, an attacker may have been able to gain access to the web server. You are getting alerts from the security services you’ve put in place indicating malicious activity. These alerts include communication with known malicious IP addresses, account reconnaissance, changes to an Amazon S3 bucket configuration, and disabling security configurations. You must identify what activity the intruder may have performed and how they did it so you can block the intruder’s access, remediate the vulnerabilities, and restore the configuration to its proper state.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-compromised-aws-iam-credentials">Part 1 - Compromised AWS IAM credentials</h2>
<h3 id="detect-and-investigate">Detect and investigate</h3>
<p>By now you’ve received email alerts from the security services you enabled. Now what? As part of your risk driven detection strategy your organization has decided to prioritize AWS IAM related findings.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sort through your email alerts and identity an alert related to an AWS IAM principal</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Amazon GuardDuty Finding: UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/MaliciousIPCaller.Custom</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the <code>&lt;Access Key ID&gt;</code> from the e-mail alert.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Explore findings related to the access key (Amazon GuardDuty)</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have a resource identifier to pivot from you can use Amazon GuardDuty to start doing an initial investigation into these findings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/" target="_blank">Amazon GuardDuty</a> console (us-west-2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click in the <strong>Add filter criteria</strong> box, select <strong>Access Key ID</strong>, and then paste in the <code>&lt;Access Key ID&gt;</code> you copied from the e-mail, then select <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition question">
<p class="admonition-title">What findings do you see related to this Access Key ID? and what do they mean ?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on one of the <strong>UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/MaliciousIPCaller.Custom</strong> findings to see the details. This finding indicates a API call was invoked from an IP on a custom malicous IP caller list. </p>
<div class="admonition question">
<p class="admonition-title">Looking at the finding details, can you identify what API calls were made?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under <strong>Resources affected</strong> section in the finding details, you will be able to identify the instance ID of the EC2 instance to whom these credentials belonged to. It starts with <strong> ‘i’, such as i-08fa26ffb15a66f5a</strong>. Copy the instance ID as we will need it for later investigations to identify how credentails were compromised in the first place.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">The credentials belong to the role that is assigned to the EC2 instance</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, lets identify which role the access key belongs to. Examine the finding JSON by clicking on the Finding ID hyperlink. </p>
<p><img alt="03-findingID-link" src="../images/03-findingID-hyperlink.png" /></p>
<p>Scroll untill you find the <strong>accessKeyDetails</strong> section you can see that the access key referenced in this finding is from an IAM assumed role, which means the Access Key credentials used to invoke these API calls belong to a IAM Role. Copy the name of the role, we will need it for remediation purposes. </p>
<p><img alt="03-AccessKeyJSON" src="../images/03-AccessKeyJSON.png" /></p>
<div class="admonition question">
<p class="admonition-title">Looking through other GuardDuty findings with a similar investigation mind set, what other infomration would you want to glean?</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<!--
6. Examining **IAM instance profile** under **Resource affected** you will find two strings separated by a new line. The first is the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html" target="_blank">Amazon Resource Name (ARN)</a> of the IAM role that was compromised. The second line will be the  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-unique-ids" target="_blank">unique ID</a> for the IAM role. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html" target="_blank">Instance Profile</a> allows you to pass a role to an EC2 instance.   

    !!! info "You may have to resize your screen by dragging the middle vertical scrollbar to the left to see the entire text"  

    The unique ID in **IAM instance profile** identifies the entity making the API request, and when the request is made using temporary security credentials (which is what happens for an assume role call) it also includes a session name. In this case the session name is the EC2 instance ID since the assume role call was done using an IAM role for EC2.



7. Copy the full **Iam instance profile** which contains both the unique ID of the role and the IAM Role ARN: 
**"Iam instance profile": "
`< ARN>`
 `<unique ID >`"**


8. Examine the **Iam instance profile** under **Resource affected** and copy it down. This corresponds to the name of the IAM role involved since the temp creds used to make the API call came from EC2 instance with an IAM role attached. 

<!--

To use SH for this we could use the insight "AWS users with the most suspicious activity" but that would be a stretch - no way to take this and figure out an IAM role is involved just by using the SH console.


1. Go to the [AWS Security Hub](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/home?region=us-west-2#/investigate) console.
2. The link should take you to the **Investigate** section but if not, click on **Investigate** in the navigation on the left.
3. Click in the **Add filter** box:

    * Scroll down to **Severity Label**, change the operator to **EQUALS** and type in **MEDIUM**

    * Use your browser's find function **Control-F** and paste in the `<Access Key ID>` you copied from the e-mail. 

    >  What findings do you see related to this access-key ID?

4. Click on one of the findings to see the details.

    > Where did these credentials come from? 

Examining **userType** under **Resource details**/**Details** you can see that the access key referenced in this finding is from an IAM assumed role. Examining **principalID** under **Details** you will find two strings separated by a colon. The first is the [unique ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-unique-ids) for the role and the second is the EC2 instance ID. The **principalID** contains a unique ID for the entity making the API request, and when the request is made using temporary security credentials (which is what happens for an assume role call) it also includes a session name. In this case the session name is the EC2 instance ID  since the assume role call was done using an IAM role for EC2.

5. Copy the full **principalId** which contains both the unique ID of the role and the session name
    * **"principalId": "`< unique ID >:< session name >`"**

6. Click **Cancel** (upper right-hand corner) to return back to the findings and paste only the **unique ID** into the filter:
    * **Keyword: `<unique ID>`**

Filtering on the access key ID like you did previously earlier will only show you findings related to that specific access key.  In this case the access key is from an assumed role call which means it will change over time.  Rather than using the access key id you can filter on the unique ID for the AWS IAM role which will show you all findings related to any access keys generated by that AWS IAM role.

7. After you have applied the filter check all the checkboxes for the findings, click **Actions**, and set active status to **In Progress** (since we are actively investigating this.)

8. Click **Create Insight** so you can further track findings related to this IAM principal.  Enter the following into insight name **`Show me findings related to <Unique ID>`** and toggle the **Display on insights page** so it is enabled and click **Ok**

<p>Now that you have identified that a temporary security credential from an IAM role for EC2 is being used by an attacker, the decision has been made to rotate the credential immediately to prevent any further misuse or potential privilege escalation.</p>

<p><strong>Restart the EC2 instance to rotate the access keys (EC2)</strong></p>
<p>All active credentials for the compromised IAM role have been invalidated.  This means the attacker can no longer use those access keys, but it also means that any applications that use this role can't as well.  You knew this going in but decided it was necessary due to the high risk of a compromised IAM access key. In order to ensure the availability of your application you need to refresh the access keys on the instance by stopping and starting the instance. <em>A simple reboot will not change the keys.</em> If you waited, the temporary security credential on the instance would be refreshed but this procedure will speed things up. Since you are using AWS Systems Manager for administration on your EC2 instances you can use it to query the metadata to validate that the access keys were rotated after the instance restart.</p>

<p>Now that you've addressed the compromised IAM credential you need focus in on how the attacker was able to compromise the EC2 instance. It's this compromise which allowed them to query the instance metadata and steal the credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Explore findings related to the instance ID (AWS Security Hub)</strong></p>
<p>When investigating the compromised IAM credential you discovered that it was from an IAM role for EC2 and identified the EC2 instance ID from the principal ID of the finding.

<p>One of the findings should indicate that the EC2 instance is communicating with an IP address on a threat list (<strong>disallowed IP</strong>) which adds further evidence to the conclusion that the instance has been compromised. Another finding should indicate that a system at a particular IP address is performing an SSH brute force attack against the instance you are investigating.  You now need to investigate if the SSH brute force attack was successful and if that is what allowed the attacker to gain access to the instance.</p>
<p><strong>Determine if ssh password authentication is enabled on the EC2 instance (AWS Security Hub)</strong></p>
<p>Automated responses to threats can do many things. For example, you could have an trigger that helps gather information about the threat that could then be used in the investigation by the security team. With that option in mind, we have a CloudWatch event rule in place that will trigger an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/" target="_blank">Amazon Inspector</a> scan of an EC2 instance when GuardDuty detects a particular attack. We will use AWS Security Hub to view the findings from Inspector. We want to determine if the SSH configuration adheres to best practices. </p>

<!-- ## Part 3 - Compromised S3 bucket

### Detect 

Now that we know the SSH brute force attack was successful and we disabled the IAM credentials that were stolen, we need to determine if anything else occurred. One step we could take here is to examine the IAM policy attached the IAM role that generated the temp credentials. We notice in the policy that there are permissions relating to the Amazon S3 service so that is something to keep in mind as you continue the investigation. 

Here is a truncated view of the policy from the IAM role attached to the compromised EC2 instance:

<!-- **Investigate any S3 related findings (AWS Security Hub)**

There are many ways to approach this next step. We are going to start with a Security Hub insight that may be helpful in situations like this. This is not the only way you could approach this but it can definitely save time initially as you investigate the full repercussions of an attack.

1. Go to <a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/home?region=us-west-2#/insights" target="_blank">AWS Security Hub</a> in the AWS Management Console.
2. The link should take you to the **Insights** section (if not, click on ** Insights** in the navigation on the left).
3. Click in the **Filter insights** box and type **`Top S3`** which will display the built in Insight "Top S3 buckets by counts of findings." Click on that Insight. 
4. There should be one that with **threat-detection-wksp-** and ends in **-data**. Click on that. 
5. Evaluate the Macie findings shown under the Insight.

This **Security Hub** Insight is one way of determining what an attacker may have done. It is not going to help in every situation though. 

**Check if sensitive data was involved (Macie)**

At this point you know how the attacker was able to get into your systems and a general idea of what they did. In the previous step you  determined that the S3 bucket that starts with **threat-detection-wksp-** and ends in **-data** has an ACL that grants global read rights. We will now check if there is any sensitive and business-critical data in the bucket and take a closer at the Macie Alerts.

1. Go to the <a href="https://mt.us-west-2.macie.aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Macie</a> in the AWS Management console.

2.  Click **Dashboard** on the left navigation.  You should see the following data classifications:
    ![Macie Classification](./images/03-macie-data.png)

    !!! info "You can slide the risk slider to filter data classifications based on risk levels."

3. Above the risk slider, click the icon for **S3 public objects and buckets**. The icon will be in the shape of a globe but you can also hover over the icons to find the right one. 
    ![Public Objects Button](./images/03-macie-public-objects-button.png)

4. Click the magnifying glass to the left of the bucket name listed.
5. Check if any of the data in the bucket is considered a high risk.  Look for the **Object PII priority** field and **Object risk level** field.

6.  Verify if any of the data is unencrypted.  Look for the **Object encryption** field. 

    !!! question "Does a portion of the blue bar indicate that encryption is set to none?."

### Respond

**Fix the permissions and encryption on the bucket (S3)**

In the previous step we determined that the S3 bucket that starts with **threat-detection-wksp-** and ends in **-data** has sensitive data and some of that data is unencrypted. We also know that the bucket grants global read rights. We need to manually fix these issues. 

1. First we will fix the permissions.  Go to <a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon S3</a> in the AWS Management Console.    
3. Find the bucket that starts with **threat-detection-wksp-** and ends in **-data**
4. Click on the **Permissions** tab then click on **ACL Control List**
5. Under **Public access** click on the radio button next to **Everyone**. Uncheck **List objects** then click **Save**.
7. Now we need to fix the encryption.  In the same bucket, click on the **Properties** tab then click on **Default encryption**
8. Set the encryption to AWS-KMS. Select the **aws/s3** key. Finally click **Save**.

    !!! info "What impact does enabling default encryption have on existing objects in the bucket?"

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the incident and further hardened your environment. This is obviously a simulation and we can not cover every aspect of the response function in the short time allotted but hopefully this gave you an idea of the capabilities available on AWS to detect, investigate and respond to threats and attacks. </p>
<hr />
<p>Here is a diagram of the attack you just investigated. Numbers 1 &amp; 2 show the SSH brute force attack and successful SSH login. Number 3 shows the S3 bucket changes the attacker made. Number 4 shows the API calls the attacker made with the IAM temporary credentials stolen from the compromised EC2 instance.
